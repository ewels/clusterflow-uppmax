# Cluster Flow: UPPMAX Scripts
UPPMAX specific scripts and resources for Cluster Flow.

See the main Cluster Flow repository here: https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow

You can find out more information about UPPMAX here: http://www.uppmax.uu.se

## UPPMAX Genomes
This script adds central UPPMAX reference genomes to `~/.clusterflow/genomes.config` (central and iGenomes).

You can run it as follows:

```
cf-uppmax --add_genomes
```

This will launch an interactive wizard to help you choose which genomes you would like to use, before setting up your genomes config file for you.
